FLR stands for "Freedom Learning Recording."

- **Freedom** of will is always my goal, and this site is a presentation of my freedom of writing.
- **Learning** makes me happy and helps me know the world.
- **Recording** my thoughts and experiences and share these with others to get some exchanges.

All in all, I want to be a better person and the world to be a better place.
